This is a single-page web application built with React, designed to help users organize and manage travel destinations. The app allows users to view, save, and delete places of interest, providing a personalized experience through geolocation.

The frontend uses React with Vite and a component-based architecture. State is managed with React Hooks, and a custom hook (useFetch) simplifies HTTP requests. It features reusable components, modals for confirmations and error handling, and a progress bar for timed actions.

The applicationâ€™s main features include displaying locations sorted by distance, managing favorite destinations, and offering a responsive interface with animations for a smooth and engaging user experience.
